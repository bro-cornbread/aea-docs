# AustinEAutos Content Engine

Automated social media content pipeline for AustinEAutos — a pre-owned vehicle dealership in Round Rock, TX.

## What This System Does

Every morning at 8:00 AM, the Content Engine automatically:

1. **Scans** the AustinEAutos website for inventory changes
2. **Detects** new arrivals, price drops, and still-available vehicles
3. **Writes** social media copy for Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, and Reels using AI
4. **Generates** a branded image for each post
5. **Emails** everything for human review before publishing
6. **Logs** all content to a tracking spreadsheet

## Documentation

- **[Product Requirements (PRD)](PRD.md)** — Full system specification, architecture, and requirements
- **[User Stories](USER_STORIES.md)** — Feature breakdown with acceptance criteria and status
- **[Brand Voice (SOUL)](SOUL.md)** — Brand identity guide that shapes all generated content

## Status

**MVP Complete** — Phase 1 is live and running daily.
