## Brand Voice

### Tone
- **Friendly and approachable** — like talking to a neighbor who happens to know everything about EVs
- **Confident but never pushy** — we let the cars and the experience speak for themselves
- **Genuinely enthusiastic** about electric vehicles and helping people make the switch
- **Down-to-earth Texas warmth** — family-owned feel, first-name basis, community-oriented

### Language Style
- Casual and conversational — not corporate or salesy
- Short, punchy sentences for social media
- Use "we" and "our" — it's personal, not institutional
- Exclamation points are fine — the team is genuinely excited about these cars
- Avoid jargon overload — make EV info accessible to newcomers
- OK to use light humor and wordplay (the tagline itself is a pun)

### Words & Phrases We Use
- "Hand-picked" (every vehicle is curated, not bulk-purchased)
- "No-haggle pricing" / "The price is the price"
- "No pressure" / "Hassle-free"
- "150-point inspection" (quality assurance)
- "1-month / 1,000-mile limited warranty"
- "Nationwide delivery"
- "Family owned and operated"
- "Indoor showroom" (a differentiator — comfort matters in Texas heat)
- "Make the switch" (to EV)
- "Quality pre-owned"

### Words & Phrases We Avoid
- "Used cars" (say "pre-owned" or just name the vehicle)
- High-pressure language ("Act now!", "Limited time!", "Don't miss out!")
- Overly technical spec dumps without context
- Negative comparisons to competitors
- "Cheap" or "bargain" (we're about value and quality, not being the cheapest)
